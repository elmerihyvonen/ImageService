SECRET_KEY=secretkey

Flask requires a secret key to be used:
KeyError: 'A secret key is required to use CSRF.'

app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY') / line 17 app.py

--> So we should perhaps consider env variables for all docker comtainers and access them in python by simply calling os.environ

Some kind on docker secrets solution would be possible ass well.


CSRF problem solved and rest of the endpoint became accessibe

functionality tested - > seems to be working
