SECRET_KEY=secretkey

Flask requires a secret key to be used:
KeyError: 'A secret key is required to use CSRF.'

app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY') / line 17 app.py

--> So we should perhaps consider env variables for all docker comtainers and access them in python by simply calling os.environ

Some kind on docker secrets solution would be possible ass well.
